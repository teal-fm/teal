# Amethyst

The teal.fm app.

## What?

This is a [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/) app built with [Expo](https://expo.dev/).

We use [NativeWind](https://nativewind.dev/) for styling, and for UI components, we use [React Native Reusables](https://github.com/mrzachnugent/react-native-reusables).
Would highly recommend reading the "getting started" and "guides" sections on each.

## Development

Copy the [.env.template](.env.template) and name it `.env`

set `EXPO_PUBLIC_DID_WEB` to the domain aqua is running on.
For example if it's running at `aqua.teal.fm` it would be
`EXPO_PUBLIC_DID_WEB=did:web:aqua.teal.fm`. This is how amethyst sends requests to the appview.
