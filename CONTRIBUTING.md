### Hi, thanks for showing interest in our project, we appreciate you wanting to be a part of it!

> ###### Do you accept external contributions?
> Yes, we welcome external contributions! The only request we have is that you check with us before working on a large feature, as we'd prefer to avoid duplicating effort. 
>
> You can do this by either creating an issue that we can communicate through, or popping into the Discord channel and asking in the #development channel. Whatever works best for you!
>
> Other than that, feel free to contribute however you'd like!
